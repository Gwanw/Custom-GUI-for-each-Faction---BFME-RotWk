# Custom GUI for each Faction - BFME RotWk  

This project adds a custom palantir and the all-hero-button for up to ten factions to the game.  

The templates for the designs can be found and replaced in art/Textures. Look for the textures with the standard palantir frame.  
The names for the factions are: Men, Elves, Mordor, Isengard, Dwarves, Wild, Angmar, Rohan, Imladris, Evilmen  
If other factions are used the names in the FactionFrame.apt have to be changed aswell.  

For converting the apt/const/xml files Feliwirs Apt Converter is recommended.
